## Introduction

The BakerTime App is an open source solution that utilizes the AppBakery to provide an overview of ongoing projects (pastries) and plan new ones.

### Models
#### AppBaker
AppBakers are the key resources of the app. They have a name, a specific quota which they work for the AppBakery, and Flavours, which define the technologies mastered by an AppBaker. An AppBaker also has a list of Pastries and the AppBaker's quota per Pastry.

#### Pastry
Pastries are the initiatives of the AppBakery where an AppBaker is involved. A Pastry has a baking type that indicates the type of this baked good, whether it's an innovation initiative, a project for a DSO, an initiative for a circle, vacation, etc. The baked good also has a start time, a duration, and a size that indicates how many AppBakers are needed.

### Screens
#### Dashboard
An overview of all AppBakers showing the workload from today up to the next three months.

#### AppBaker Profile
Here you can see the AppBaker in detail, what flavours they have and which current and future projects are planned.

#### Pastry Overview
This is the detailed view per pastry.
